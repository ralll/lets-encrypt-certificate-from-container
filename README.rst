Steps to create Let's Encrypt certificates with containers
==========================================================

This project gives a simple way, using docker containers, to obtain certificate's domain to use with ``https://`` connections in a web server.

For beginnng developers, it may be difficult to obtain the Let's Encrypt certificate because of non-trivial configurations, such as web server settings or provider options.

Following the steps bellow, it's possible to download the certificate to a docker volume in a webserver and, then, to install in the remote servers.

.. warning:: 

  Be carefully with certificates.

  **Don't use non-secure connections** with server, **review the firewall configutations** and take other **security measures** to avoid leaking of keys.

***************************
Release notes version 1.1.0
***************************

Changes
=======

No significant change. Docker images versions and other minor updates.

************
Requirements
************

* DNS service configured. The site (domain) already runs in HTTP (insecure) mode.
* Docker-engine installed on server.
* Docker-machine installed on host (developer computer).

.. note:: These procedures were tested in a Digital Ocean droplet. It supose to work in simular way in others providers.

************************************************************
Step 0: Change the configurations to the desired web address
************************************************************

Change the file **nginx.conf**, line 12, **DOMAIN_ADDRESS** to domain address URL.

Put your email and domain address URL when to run the **certbot container**:
  
 * **-m user@exemplo.com**.
 * **-d test.com**.

Connect to the server with docker-machine.

.. code-block:: bash

  eval $(docker-machine env droplet-name)

*************************************
Step 01: Run the web server container
*************************************

After connected in the server with docker-machine, use the command bellow to create a web server image.

.. code-block:: bash

  docker build -f web_server.dockerfile -t web_server .

  Sending build context to Docker daemon  8.192kB
  Step 1/2 : FROM nginx:1.17
   ---> cd5239a0906a
  Step 2/2 : COPY ./nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   ---> 192362c0a39c
  Successfully built 192362c0a39c
  Successfully tagged web_server:latest

Then start the web_server with the compose file.
The service will contain two volumes:

* **letsencrypt:** save the certificate files.
* **acme-challenge:** the certbot container checks.

.. code-block:: bash

  docker-compose -f certbot_nginx_compose.yml -p cert up --build -d

  Creating network "cert_default" with the default driver
  Creating volume "cert_letsencrypt" with default driver
  Creating volume "cert_acme-challenge" with default driver
  Creating web_server ... done

After rise the container, verify if everything is working fine:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ docker ps

  CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                                      NAMES
  8ad20af9ea93        web_server          "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp   web_server

  $ docker logs web_server

  162.216.152.41 - - [12/Jun/2018:02:40:11 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 612 "-" "-"

  $ docker volume ls

  DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
  local               cert_acme-challenge
  local               cert_letsencrypt

And finally check with the web server is accessible by the web. To open the URL in the browser:

.. code-block:: bash

  Welcome to nginx!


  If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and working. Further configuration is required.

  For online documentation and support please refer to nginx.org.
  Commercial support is available at nginx.com.

  Thank you for using nginx.

**********************************
Step 02: Run the certbot container
**********************************

The command lines options explanation:

* **-it:** for interactive interface in the container.
* **--rm:** to remove certbot container after run.
* **--volumes-from:** to attach the volumes from other containers.
* **--webroot and --webroot-path:** certbot configurations.
* **--agree-tos:** License agreement.
* **--dry-run:** For tests. Just check the configurations. Don't download certificates.
* **--staging:** For tests. Test configurations and download **non-valid** certificates.
* **-m:** email address from responsible for domain.
* **-d:** the domain address URL.

Dry-run
=======

It's recommended to run a dry-run procedure first.

It will test the configurations, but it won't download any certificates.

.. code-block:: bash

  docker run -it --rm \
    --volumes-from web_server \
    certbot/certbot certonly \
    --webroot \
    --webroot-path /tmp/letsencrypt/www \
    --agree-tos \
    --staging \
    --dry-run \
    -m user@exemplo.com \
    -d test.com

  IMPORTANT NOTES:
   - The dry run was successful.
   - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
     configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
     secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
     also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
     making regular backups of this folder is ideal.

Staging
=======

Once the dry-run perfomed without errors, it's time to staging procedure.

It will test the configurations and to download **non-valid** certificates.

.. code-block:: bash

  docker run -it --rm \
    --volumes-from web_server \
    certbot/certbot certonly \
    --webroot \
    --webroot-path /tmp/letsencrypt/www \

  IMPORTANT NOTES:
   - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
     /etc/letsencrypt/live/test.com/fullchain.pem
     Your key file has been saved at:
     /etc/letsencrypt/live/test.com/privkey.pem
     Your cert will expire on 2018-09-10. To obtain a new or tweaked
     version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
     again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
     "certbot renew"


Complete verification
=====================

Finally, the time has come for the full check.

It will download the oficial certificate to the letsencrypt volume (attached to web_server container).

.. note::

  Be sure before trying for real to avoid to be blocked by the Let's Encrypt service for excessive requests.

  Pass through **dry-run** and **staging** modes before this step.

.. code-block:: bash

  docker run -it --rm \
    --volumes-from web_server \
    certbot/certbot certonly \
    --webroot \
    --webroot-path /tmp/letsencrypt/www \

      Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le

**Obs:**

The existing certificate is the **non-valid** certificate created in the step 02.

If you prefer, it is possible to remove the volume (`docker volume rm cert_letsencrypt`) and rerun the web_server service (compose file) and the certbot container.


Step 03: Retry the certificate
==============================

If the certbot container runs without errors, the certificates will be available in the letsencrypt volume attached to web container.

Copy the certificate to developer machine. Change ``/home/developer/some-path/letsencrypt/`` bellow to a desire path.

.. code-block:: bash

  docker-machine scp -r server_name:/var/lib/docker/volumes/cert_letsencrypt/_data /home/developer/some-path/letsencrypt/
